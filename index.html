<h2>Brief about me</h2>
<p>
I am an international student from Shanghai, China studying in University of Iowa. My majors are Markeing and M.I.S. I am 22 years old girl who has a boyfriend. He also comes from Shanghai, China. I love programming, though I only know visual basic and python so far. I have great interest in computer and creating something new by myself. This is my first time touching html coding. This is really fun and challenging to me.
</p>

<p>
As you can see, I look so similar to my Mum. I love my Mum so much and so miss her right now. We always go shopping together. We are more like sisters rather than Mother and daughter. I enjoy this kind of relationship.
</p>

<p>
I spent 19 years in Shanghai before I came to America when I was 19 years old. Unlike most students in Shanghai, I spent 7 years in girls' school. It is the only public girls' school in China. I really love the life and time I spent there. I met lots of friends there. More importantly, I met 4 whole-life friend through the 7 years. My school's mission is IACE, which stands for independent, able, care and elegance. I believe I am this kind of girl.
